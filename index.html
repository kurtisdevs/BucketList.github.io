    <h1>Bucket List</h1>
    <p>I am building this website so that I can learn...to build websites. I am creating a bucket list so that I have a
        clear list of all of the things I want to accomplish in life.</p>
    <p>I recently had a revelation that I know is not news to many people, and it's not necessarily something I haven't
        heard before. But it struck a chord with me in a different way this time: live your dream life now. Don't wait
        to exercise when you have more time. Don't wait to learn about a place, including a new language, until you're
        about to go on a trip there. If you want to visit Spain some day so that you can get to know the culture, learn
        Spanish now. Cook Spanish food now. Read books by Spaniards now.</p>
